Because of limited of file size, the trained model and dataset are on google drive with following link:

Trained model : https://drive.google.com/file/d/188gdv5nLEQfFAnCqHSmq9bX6FRkh34E_/view?usp=sharing

Dataset : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wYVdCSW8ipjJ2Zr8zoqe1w1LGc5jhufW/view?usp=sharing (.zip) or  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DV-mZ2Vk2M_zjpsFZ1mDzOI792Bx6pNX?usp=sharing (folder)

The Code will work if the "Dataset" folder are located on the same directory with the "Create Model.ipynb"
